## Thought process

### Clients

Tickets can only be created by Clients. A client can see all open or closed tickets. A client can not comment on a newly created ticket until an agent or admin comments on it.

### Agents

An agent can see open tickets and process any of them, the tickets are arranged in reversed order, meaning last created ticket appears last on the list. Agents can also close the tickets once it has been successfuly resolved. Agent can download recently closed/processed (30 days) tickets as PDF.

### Admins

An admin can see open tickets and process any of them, the tickets are arranged in reversed order, meaning last created ticket appears last on the list. Admin can download recently closed/processed (30 days) tickets as PDF. Admins can also close the tickets once it has been successfuly resolved. Admin can also view clients, agents, and admins. Admin can promote or demote a user to a client, agent, or admin. Admin can not demote any other admin.
